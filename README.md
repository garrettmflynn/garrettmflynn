# Hello! It's Garrett ðŸ‘‹
I'm a senior software engineer at [Universal Brain](https://universal-brain.com) currently based in Los Angeles. Nearly all of my work is open-source and publicly available here on GitHub.

Over the last few years, I've designed and developed user-friendly neuroscience applications with [Catalyst Neuro](https://catalystneuro.com), [Enosis](https://enosis.io), the [Human Technology Interaction Lab](https://htilua.org/), and several others.

Beyond programming, I enjoy rock climbing and playing with my cats Polymer and Jorts.
