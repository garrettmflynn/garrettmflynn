### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Garrett Flynn**. I'm a full-stack neurotechnologist and MA student in Media Arts, Games, and Health @ [USC](https://usc.edu).

My passion is neural interface engineering and integrating user feedback into early-stage neurotechnology design. If you like those topics feel free to say hi here or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/garrettmflynn) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/garrettmflynn).
