# Hello! It's Garrett ðŸ‘‹
I'm a senior software engineer at [Universal Brain](https://universal-brain.com) currently based in Los Angeles.

In my spare time, I design and develop user-friendly neuroscience applications. Previous clients include [Catalyst Neuro](https://catalystneuro.com), [Enosis](https://enosis.io), and the [Human Technology Interaction Lab](https://htilua.org/). Nearly all of this work is open-source and publicly available here on GitHub.

After a full day of programming, I enjoy rock climbing and playing with my cats Polymer, Jorts, Brian, and Soup.
