I'm a transdisciplinary researcher, web engineer, and founding partner at [Brains@Play](https://github.com/brainsatplay): a worker-owned development studio that designs public biomedical infrastructure on the Open Web.

In May 2022, I graduated with a BS in Computational Neuroscience and an [MA in Media Arts, Games, and Health](https://cmbhc.usc.edu/?page_id=1990) from the University of Southern California.
